# NASA-Turbofan-Jet-Engine
Goal is to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of each engine in the test dataset. RUL is equivalent of number of flights remained for the engine after the last datapoint in the test dataset.
# Model 
- Classification :
  * Logistic Regression
  * ANN

# Evaluation
Each model's performance is evaluated based on relevant metrics for classification and regression tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or Mean Squared Error (MSE).

# Usage

Run the Notebook: Open and run RUL files provided in a Jupyter environment.
Model Training and Evaluation: Follow each section to train, test, and evaluate the models.
Results: Analyze model results to choose the optimal approach.
# Project Results

This project provides insights into different modeling approaches for RUL prediction, comparing the strengths of classic machine learning models with an ANN-based model for classification.
